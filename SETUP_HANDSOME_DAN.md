# 🐕 Handsome Dan Setup Instructions

## ✅ Code Changes Complete!
All code has been committed (commit: 7d7159f)

## 📦 What You Need To Do

### 1. Add the Handsome Dan Images
You need to save the two bulldog images to the images folder:

**Location:** `/Users/kmr/rememberSOMthing/frontend/images/`

**File names:**
- `handsome-dan-1.png` - First image (dark sweater, no Y)
- `handsome-dan-2.png` - Second image (with Y on sweater)

### 2. Access the Application

**Open in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000
```

Or click here: http://localhost:8000/index.html

### 3. Test the Animation

1. Click on the **"📤 Upload"** tab
2. Select a PDF file
3. Click **"Upload & Generate Cards"**
4. Watch Handsome Dan march across the screen! 🎉

The two images will cycle every 1 second while the AI processes your document.

## 🎬 How It Works

- **Walk Animation**: Dan walks from left to right across the screen (3 seconds)
- **Image Cycling**: Images switch every 1 second
- **Direction Flip**: At the midpoint, Dan flips and walks back
- **Auto-Stop**: Animation stops when upload completes

## ⚠️ Important Note

**The animation will show a broken image icon until you save the actual Handsome Dan images!**

Once you save both PNG files to `frontend/images/`, refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R) and the images will appear.

## 🔧 Server Status

✅ Server is running on port 8000
✅ Auto-reload is enabled
✅ All dependencies installed

Enjoy your new Handsome Dan loading animation! 🐶💙
