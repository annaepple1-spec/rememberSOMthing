# Handsome Dan Images

This directory contains the Handsome Dan images used in the loading animation.

## Required Images

You need to save the two Handsome Dan images as:
1. `handsome-dan-1.png` - First bulldog image with sweater
2. `handsome-dan-2.png` - Second bulldog image with Y sweater

The images will cycle during PDF processing to show the AI is working.

## How to Add Images

1. Save the first Handsome Dan image (dark sweater, no Y) as `handsome-dan-1.png`
2. Save the second Handsome Dan image (with Y on sweater) as `handsome-dan-2.png`
3. Both files should be in this `/frontend/images/` directory

The images will automatically:
- Switch every 1 second during upload
- Walk across the screen from left to right
- Flip direction halfway through the animation
